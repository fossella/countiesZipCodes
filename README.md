# countiesZipCodes
CSV file matching ZIP Codes to US County-equivalents

## Notes
- Includes all counties and county-equivalents, as defined by the US Census (https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html).
- The codes have been mapped to the county where their post office is physically located- some addresses may be outside that county.
- ZIP codes that don't correspond to physical locations in the US (for instance, military zip codes) have been excluded.
